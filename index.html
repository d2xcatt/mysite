          <h3>Development</h3>
          <p>I started learning JAVA at the age of 31. Having no technical backround I just found random online courses and went with it. Even though learning to code was engaging from the start,
            many things confused me. The more I learnt the more overwhelmed I felt, until the moment my motivation and enthusiasm were completely drained by not having a clear direction.
            I gave up, assuming that probably coding was not for me. I was wrong. One year later I started a Web Development course on <a class="udemy" href="https://www.udemy.com/" target="_blank">udemy.com</a>
            and realized how much smoother the learning process could be when the course was designed well. I enjoy every moment of studying and look forward to applying my knowledge in
            the professional environment.</p>

          <h3>Human Chess</h3>
          <p>Even though recently I have been spending most of my time in front of the computer screen, I enjoy an occasional sports activity. I have tried many ways to strain my cardio, but the one I always
             come back to is Brazilian Jiu Jitsu. There is something about this sport that appeals to one's instincts and as a result I always leave the training session in a good mood. I have been doing
             it for so long that I even started conducting classes myself teaching this beautiful art to other enthusiasts.</p>
